# Label detection function

This is the starter source for the image label detection function used in the blog post, [OK Google, what do you see? - Labelling images in Google Cloud](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/01/27/labelling-images-in-google-cloud.html).

There is also an [example implementation](/example-function) of the `detectLabels` function.
